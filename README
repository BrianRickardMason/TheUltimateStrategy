The Ultimate Strategy is a MMOBS game based on C++. It is open to all
programming languages. It is not derived from any other project.

The MMOBS acronym stands for Massive Multiple Online Bot Strategy.

The main goal of the project is to create the league for programmers willing
to create (develop) bot players (i.e. programs that will pretend
to be players).
