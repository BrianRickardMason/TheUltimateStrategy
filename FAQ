CHAPTER: BASICS.

* What is The Ultimate Strategy?

The Ultimate Strategy is a Massive Multiple Online Bot Strategy game. Each of the human players creates a bot. The bot
participates in tournaments that take place on a server. A moderator bot is taking care of the tournament.

The game is meant to be highly configurable. An administrator can easily modify, narrow or even extend available
configurations. Some of the parts of the game are tightly coupled and some are not. Some of the dependencies will be
covered in this FAQ.
